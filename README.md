# Coding-1-Final
 These are the starter files for F2020 Coding 1

 My website is about my lifelong relationship with gaming. For as long as I've known, I have always been interested in video games and watching gameplays. I believe that my love for gaming came from watching my father play all different kinds of games. One day, he decided to let me play a game or two, and I've been hooked ever since. I play all sorts of games, but as of now I usually play Animal Crossing, Call of Duty MW, and Mario Kart 8. This website is to blog and record my experiences and ratings of the many games I have played and will play. With this website, Iâ€™ll be able to grow as a content creator and be able to inspire other girls to be proud of having a passion to game.
